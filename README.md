## Installation Guide:
If you do not already have the required technologies installed, install them now through your terminal or Gitbash. 
For example:

> pip install streamlit
> pip install web3==5.17
> pip install bip44
> pip install dataclasses

If you do not already have Ganache, download and install the lastest version of Ganache. To create a workspace, click on "Quickstart Ethereum".

To run it from local computer, clone repo. From the Terminal, activate conda envirnoment; change directory to repo folder, and type streamlit run pychain.py. This will launch a web browser with a local URL such as http://localhost:8501. Note that you will need to install some libraries/dependencies if you do not already have them.
